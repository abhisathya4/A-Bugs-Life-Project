Initial Setup:
  Download and build OpenCV libraries
  https://docs.opencv.org/master/d0/db2/tutorial_macos_install.html 

  Initialize CMake OPENCV_DIR to the directory of those files

Usage:

  Either compile using CLion or with cmake .. when in the project directory

  The test suite can be run by including it in the CMake executable list

  The resultant application can be used by creating a AntProc object(video_path) and using the member function ContourFinder(). Further implemenation of a command  line interface would be useful.

Enjoy!
